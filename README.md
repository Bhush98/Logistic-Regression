# Logistic-Regression
Logistic Regression is a part of the regression family .
It's the same as linear regression with a little twist but with a twist
it uses the sigmoid function to generate a probability value between 0 and 1.
and if the value exceeds the specified threshold the output is 1.
else it returns 0.
